**Text-Summarization App using NLTK, Spacy using Streamlit**

**SPACY:**
Spacy is an open-source software python library used in advanced natural language processing and machine learning. It will be used to build information extraction, natural language understanding systems, and to pre-process text for deep learning. It supports deep learning workflow in convolutional neural networks in parts-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition.

**Installation:**
pip3 install spacy

**NLTK:**
NLTK stands for Natural Language Toolkit.The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a platform used for building Python programs that work with human language data for applying in statistical natural language processing (NLP).It contains text processing libraries for tokenization, parsing, classification, stemming, tagging and semantic reasoning.

**Installation:**
pip3 install nltk

**NLP:**
It is the ability of a computer program to understand human language as it is spoken and written referred to as natural language. It is a component of artificial intelligence(AI).

There are two main phases to natural language processing: 

1.data preprocessing

2.algorithm development

**Streamlit:**
It is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. In just a few minutes you can build and deploy powerful data apps.

**Installation:**
pip3 install streamlit

**To run the file:**
streamlit run filename.py
